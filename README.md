# RPNCalculator

An RPN Calculator written in C++ using the Qt framework.

This project is very rough. I started it last summer to learn more about C++, GUIs, Git, and software development in general.

Current issues:
  1) negative signs are printed on the wrong side of the number
  2) new entries scroll from top->bottom instead of bottom->top
  3) width is not fixed

To test the current build for yourself please visit the releases page: https://github.com/wftmate/RPNCalculator/releases

To run the windows version, please download and unzip the current release. The executable can be run from within that folder.

Currently, a build is available for windows. A linux build is coming soon.
